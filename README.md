# eye-state-monitoring
A real-time drowsiness detection system that alerts drivers if they begin to fall asleep. Built using OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Haar Cascade classifiers, this project uses computer vision and machine learning to monitor eye states and trigger alerts when prolonged eye closure is detected.
Features:
1.🎥 Real-time webcam integration
2.👁️ Eye detection using Haar Cascade
3.🧠 Deep learning model to classify "open" vs "closed" eyes
4.🚨 Alert system using winsound (for Windows) or buzzer simulation
5.📊 Model trained on labeled eye images
6.📦 Modular code, easy to integrate or extend
Tech.Used:
 *Python
 *OpenCV
 *TensorFlow / Keras
 *NumPy
 *Haar Cascade Classifiers
 *Winsound (for alarm)
