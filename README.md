# eye-state-monitoring
A real-time drowsiness detection system that alerts drivers if they begin to fall asleep. Built using OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Haar Cascade classifiers, this project uses computer vision and machine learning to monitor eye states and trigger alerts when prolonged eye closure is detected.
